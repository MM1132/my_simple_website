		<h3>Job Interview</h3>
		<p>
      Apparently I had applied for a "Sales Secretary" role, 
      and it felt a bit embarassing that I didn't even know about it during the interview. 

      The interview felt amazing - like a coaching session, as talking to the owner of the company, 
      I started to realize that I didn't even know what role I actually would have wanted to have in the company, 
      if any. He said that he would love to have me in the company as a programmer for my qualifications and 
      analytical personality type, and that I could contact him anytime if I am interested. Just not as the "Sales Secretary", 
      as he thinks I would get bored at that job super quickly. I am thankful to him and I promised to think about it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening when thinking about the jobs would actually fit me, I had a long conversation with ChatGPT 
      and Gemini on what would make me feel most fulfilled in my life right now. 
      It came out that it would fit me very well to be a team/product manager, 
      an IT teacher, or just create YouTube tutorials about everything I learn day by day. That kind of excited me :)

    <h3>A spontaneous idea</h3>
    <p>
      Just a few days ago I had this weird thought of... what if I rented a big venue in the 
      capital city of Estonia, and hosted my own standup show there. I would do all advertisement 
      and marketing, create social media content for it, create posters and business cards and 
      also design shirts with my logo :) I could also do the sound and lighting setups, and 
      create a website for it myself. And also sell tickets for it and perform myself as well. 
      Wouldn't that just be a super cool experience? 
    </p>
    <p>
      When telling about this idea to ChatGPT, it confirms that I would gain a lot of
      new interesting experiences and develop a lot as a person. It also says that lots of people would
      love such risk-taking narrative: "A programmer trying standup for the first time with no prior stage experience". 
      Not to mention, it would of course be super scary, and to do it, I would have to get out of my comfort zone way more than 
      I ever have in my life before. And I have no idea what I would even talk about or do on the stage. But it would be cool! 
      And it would be sad if I didn't go through with it and do it, because... I can do it ;)
