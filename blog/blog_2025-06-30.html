		<h3>Learning more C++</h3>
		<p>
			Today I was learning some more C++, continuing my beautiful journey.
			It has been fun so far, and I am actually finding it interesting - and so far
			I seem to like C++ more than other usual kind of OOP languages that I have
			used in the past. It has this very interesting form to it - that everything
			is super strict, yet the same time very versatile. I like it a lot, and I
			feel like I am learning a lot of new things, which is making it fun for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			The biggest learning today was the `inline` keyword, in terms of overriding the << operator for std::ostream. I
			found out that even if I have the header guards for an .hpp file, it will only protect you from including
			the header file twice within the same .cpp or .hpp file. So if we define a function in the .hpp globally,
			and then include that header file in multiple other files, we will get a bunch of errors because the same
			function will now exist in multiple locations. Therefore, it is best to just write the prototype for the
			function in the .hpp file, and have the actual definition of it in the .cpp. A cool workaround that I found
			- in case you really really want to have the definition of the function in the header file, is to define it
			as "inline" . This keyword tells the compiler that if this function is included multiple times, just treat
			it all as one same function. Alternatively you can also define a function directly inside the definition of
			a class, since functions defined within a class, are automatically "inline". 
		</p>

		<h3>Starting to learn Angular</h3>
		<p>
			I was replied by a company that I messaged for a job offer. It seems like a cool company, so I am happy they
			replied to me. And they also gave me a small trial task to do in Angular. Since I have never done anything
			in Angular before, and have mainly concentrated myself on React, it will be a very nice challenge for me.
			Not to say that I would be concentrating myself on this project full-time, as this is sadly not possible for
			me - I will gladly use this as a very positive excuse to finally take it upon myself to learn Angular - no
			matter if I will end up getting the job or not. 
		</p>

		So today is the first day! Starting from the very basics:
		<ul>
			<li>How to create components</li>
			<li>Modifying the state</li>
			<li>Adding/changing styles</li>
			<li>...And all the other fun stuff</li>
		</ul>
